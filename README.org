* fro-dux v1
| [[images/fro_dux-v1_front.jpg]] | [[images/fro_dux-v1_back.jpg]] |

This board is a fork and customization of the [[https://github.com/andrewjrae/rae-dux][rea-dux]], which is a 36-key (diodeless!), wireless keyboard inspired by the [[https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux][Architeuthis Dux]].
You can find all relevant information there; this version would not exist without the others before :)

I primarily changed the routing of the tracks, being inspired by the original [[https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux][Architeuthis dux]] and moved the thumb-cluster more to the center.
The creator of the Architeuthis dux seems to have the awesome logo from "perce", so thank you also from my site! I could not find out who it is, maybe [[https://github.com/madebyperce/][this person]].

You can find further information in the rae-dux repo.
If you want to change something on this board, just edit 'fro_dux-v1.kicad_pcb' in KiCad and export your own gerber file.

Note, if you want to print it:

- There is only one file for both sides. Typically PCB manufacturers offer to print only more than 5 boards of one file, so the idea is to flip one board around and have the right side. I tried to make the design on both sides as similar as possible.
- If you edit the KiCAD file and export your finished version as a gerber, make sure to check "Subtract soldermask from silkscreen", so that you can solder everything together when your board arrives.
- The silkscreen currently overflows the whole keyboard as I could not find a good solution to cut the overflow. If you know how to do that, let me know :)
